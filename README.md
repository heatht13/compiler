# compiler
CS455 compiler written in C and C++. Each hw folder contains a hw spec that defines the requirements for that period
Each hw is a progression on the previous. ie hw6 should do everything hw5 does plus more. the hw folders only contain the compiled object code.
Source code resides in the master folder.
I need to clean this up, but hw7 should have a functional compiler that has already been compiled and can be used to compile the test code in testDataA7.tar
futuretips.txt was my final notes after passing this course. It contains nexts steps/goals for this compiler and known issues
