# compiler

## DISCLAIMER

* This is C/C++ written by myself when I was in school. There will be lots of mistakes, horrible code structure, and plenty of memory leaks. I wouldnt be surprised if the first thing you see is a seg fault when you run it. This code is here to offer general knowledge of what a compiler consists of and how
one might build one. Following the HW specs, you could build one yourself.

## GENERAL INFO

* CS455 compiler written in C and C++. Each hw folder contains a hw spec that defines the requirements for that period.
* Each hw is a progression on the previous. ie hw6 should do everything hw5 does plus more. The hw folders only contain the compiled object code.
* Source code resides in the master folder.
* I need to clean this up, but hw7 should have a functional compiler that has already been compiled and can be used to compile the test code in testDataA7.tar.
* futuretips.txt was my final notes after passing this course. It contains nexts steps/goals for this compiler and some known issues.
